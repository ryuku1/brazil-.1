    brazil.1.d:0 "Between the dates of 23rd and 27th of November, 1935, rising national unrest sprawled into an attempted military coup against Getúlio Vargas's government. Led by the communist group, Aliança Nacional Libertadora (ANL), and military leader, Luís Carlos Prestes. Members of the ANL viewed Vargas as a revolutionary who would continue to further plunge the country towards an authoritarian regime. The coup eventually failed and forced Prestes into hiding. Althrough victorious, Varga's government is under complete disarray and instability. Only time will tell if Vargas will be able to stabilize Brazil and possibly use this chaos to exploit what remains of the Democratic government."
    brazil.2.d:0 "Ever sence the failed 1935 Insurrection, Prestes has gone into hiding to escape federal justice. Recently caugtht trying to escape the country, Prestes's was caught by Brazilian police in Rio. Now facing the possibility of execution, Prestes's trial will be nationally televised. Many members of the military wish to see Prestes 6 feet under, while the rest of the country wish to see Prestes rot in Federal Prison for the rest of his life. Ultimately, the decision comes down to the Brazilian Government." 
    brazil.3.d:0 "The Brazilian Army has faced scruitiny and division for the last decade. Several officer revolts, ones similar to the 1935 ANL Insurrection, has greatly destroyed the Army's prestige. A prestige well now since The Great War. The time is now to take serious time and deliberation to organize the once great Brazilian Army."
    brazil.4.d:0 "On the morning November 10th, 1937, under the orders of President Getúlio Vargas, Federal soldiers surrounded the capital building and refused to let congressmen inside. Hours went by and Vargas finally addressed the nation regarding the current status of the Capital building. Vargas announced the congress will hold an emergercy hearing to determine the future leadership of the nation. At the time, many people didn't realize, but this would be the last Congressional hearing inside the Brazilian Congress, and the ubrupt end to democracy in Brazil."
    brazil.5.d:0 "Just as in our nation, the Spanish Government has been plagued by a Communist disease. The Spanish people have had their wit ends and have taken up arms. We must support these guerrilla forces and help them fight off this communist poison. And also perhaps, we could also use the experience."
    brazil.6.d:0 "Every year, on September 7th, the Brazilian people celebrate Indepence Day. After Napoleon's occupation of Portugal (1808-1815), prince regent John VI created the Kingdoms of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves, elevating Brazil to the rank of kingdom and increasing its administrative independence. Years later in 1821, Brazil revolted against Portugal. In September 7th, 1822, the event known as the Cry of Ipiranga took place on the banks of the Ipiranga brook in the city of São Paulo (which is the date of which the Brazilian Independence Day is celeberated). Days later, Pedro of Braganza was acclaimed Emperor of Brazil on 12 October 1822, being crowned and consecrated on 1 December 1822, and the country became known as the Empire of Brazil. Fighting would end in March of 1824, with the Portuguese surrender of Montevideo. Ending 322 years of colonial rule."
    brazil.7.d:0 "As the world draws to an ever-closer World War, Brazil must declare it’s intentions. Although, we have a pro-far-right government, should we render support to the axis? We are isolated and surrounded by Allied countries, and currently still rebuilding our nation’s military. I’d be of the best interest of our people and of our government, to stay out of this war as much as possible. Staying out of this war may not be possible, but every passing day, we get stronger. If we willingly choose to confront either side, there may be ever-lasting ripples that may internally divide our nation from within."
    brazil.8.d:0 "Our choice of staying Neutral in the up-and-coming conflict has been beneficial to our economy. By not taking official sides, we’ve been able to trade with both allied and axis countries. Importing German steel and importing British grain has given us the opportunity to expand our industries. German ambassadors have assured us that our shipping lanes will remain untouched by German U-boats. A concerning problem that was seen in the first World War. Only time will tell if the Germans keep their word."
